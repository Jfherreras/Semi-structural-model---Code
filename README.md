# Oxford-Writing-Sample---Code

### This hub contains the replication code for my MPhil Economics application at the University of Oxford. The document referenced as a writing sample is "Semi-structural model on developing countries after COVID-19 shock: The Colombian Case". To run the code, you must have installed Matlab and IRIS toolbox. The code was made using the 2021b Matlab and 20211222 IRIS versions. It is recommended to have the same version of IRIS and an updated version of Matlab.
### The running routine can be found in the main.m file, consistent with three files necessary to run the writing sample analyses. In addition, there are auxiliary files in the hub that are called from the main files.
